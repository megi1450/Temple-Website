                <p>Dear Residents,</p>
                <p>With devotion in our hearts and a shared commitment to our temple, we are forming the <strong>AO Temple Well-Wishers WhatsApp group</strong>. This initiative aims to support the temple‚Äôs monthly expenses through voluntary contributions from our community, providing a meaningful and sacred opportunity for those who wish to be part of this noble cause.</p>
                <p>By God's grace, until now, no temple activity has ever been interrupted. However, as our expenses have increased compared to last year, including the priest‚Äôs salary and other necessities, our intention is to ensure that every temple activity continues smoothly and that our temple never faces a shortage of anything it needs.</p>
                <p>This initiative has been inspired by some of our devoted members who expressed their wish to contribute and be part of this noble cause.</p>
                <p>If you would like to join, please find the link below:</p>
